<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Moderately AI is on a mission to make AI & ML augmented products that are easy to use, understand, and trust. A core part of this mission is our core SDK. The SDK is designed to be a collection of tools and libraries that enable you to build distributed AI and ML applications on all devices.

To learn more about what we're building and why, please visit [Moderately AI](https://moderately.ai).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get started with the SDK, you can either use Rust or Python, (NodeJS coming soon).

### Rust

MAI SDK is written in rust, as such you have the option of integrating directly with the core library, or via a simplified runtime.

Please see the [MAI SDK CORE](./mai-sdk-core/README.md) or [MAI SDK Runtime](./mai-sdk-runtime/README.md) for more information.

### Python

MAI SDK is also available in Python, it is currently not distributed on PyPi, but you can install it from source.

Please see the [MAI SDK Python](./mai-sdk-python/README.md) for more information.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

This project's current status is pre-alpha, as such the general design and architecture is going to be in flux until the end of June 2024, when the project is expected to reach alpha status. The primary reason for this is that Moderately AI, the primary developer of this project, is still determining scope of the SDK. If you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request to discuss, we'd be more than happy to talk through your change and how it may influence our early stage development!
